# Elevation Ruler World of Darkness 20th Anniversary Compatibility

Adds a very basic compatibility between [WoD 20th Anniversary System](https://github.com/JohanFalt/Foundry_WoD20) and [Elevation ruler](https://github.com/caewok/fvtt-elevation-ruler) module for Foundry VTT.
I say very basic since it only uses multipliers of the jogging speed score of a character, therefore your mileage might vary, literally, by around one or two feet.
But it should be good enough to approximate how far a character can go.
Based on [Rapunzel77](https://github.com/Rapunzel77/dsa5-elevation-ruler-integration/commits?author=Rapunzel77)'s code.
